# kafka-stock-market-project
Created a project to process data in real time using Python with pandas to read data in from a dataset, kafka to create a pipeline for the data on an EC2 instance, stored this data in an S3 bucket, and used Crawler, Glue, and Athena to conduct SQL queries on the data in real-time as it was added to the database.
